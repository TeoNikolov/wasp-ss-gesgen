# wasp-ss2023-gesgen
Repository containing code for the gesture generation part of the WASP Summer School 2023 student assignment.

**Disclaimer** The repository is WIP and may not function fully. The README is currently unavailable.

**Attribution** This repository incorporates Ubisoft's [ZeroEGGS](https://github.com/ubisoft/ubisoft-laforge-ZeroEGGS/) gesture generation AI model as part of a Dockerized environment. The only modifications performed are removal of unnecessary files and decorating functions with Celery in case the model is used as backend for a webapp.
